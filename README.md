libnostrsite is a website rendering engine for Nostr Sites (nip-512). 

It takes a website description published on nostr, and a Ghost theme published on Nostr, and a path as inputs - and produces HTML of a webpage.

The library is used by nostrsite - the client-side website rendering engine powering Nostr sites that produce HTML in the browser.

It is also used by nostr-site-cli tool to do server-side pre-rendering of webpages. And by nostr-site-manager app for producing theme previews.

This is a very early work in progress, lots of features are missing or partially implemented, the APIs will change, use at your own risk.
